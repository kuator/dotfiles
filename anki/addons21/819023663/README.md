RefoldEase sets the `Ease factor` of all the cards in your collection to the value you choose,
and updates `Interval Modifier` and `Starting Ease` in every option group.

The addon is intended for people who want to switch from default Anki settings
to the setup [recommended](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/setting-up-anki.html) by Tatsumoto.
If you've been using Anki for a while, simply changing the settings won't help
because all your cards would still retain their Ease factors.
The only way to reset Ease factors of your cards is to use an external tool.
If you have used the recommended settings from the beginning, this add-on is not needed.
The other feature of this add-on is to undo damage that was caused by overusing the "hard" button,
in other words, to swiftly escape from "ease hell."

You can run the add-on by going to `Tools > Refold Ease`.

## Installation

Install from [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/819023663), or manually with `git`:

```
git clone 'https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/RefoldEase.git' ~/.local/share/Anki2/addons21/RefoldEase
```

## Configuration

To configure the add-on, open the Anki Add-on Menu
via `Tools > Add-ons` and select `RefoldEase`.
Then click the `Config` button on the right-side of the screen.

## About

The name RefoldEase is a pun.
I changed "reset" to "refold" because an add-on named "Reset Ease" already existed on AnkiWeb,
but it didn't suit my needs.
